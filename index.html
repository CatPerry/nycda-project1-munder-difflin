				<h4><a name="our-story">Our Story</a></h4>
				<p>Munder Diffilin puts sustainability at the fore of our production process. Our products are produced by smaller mills who follow higher sourcing standards to monitor the forests from which our paper products are produced. For every pound of paper we produce we plant 10 trees with the help of local youth in our producing cities across North America.</p>
				<p>We also avoid the use of unnecessary and harmful chemicals such as bleach and dyes, and use natural alternatives that have a smaller footprint. </p>
