BOUTIQUE PAPERCRAFT COMPANY SITE

This one-page webiste was deisgned for a fictional paper company that excites the end user. On the surface, paper manufacturing may seem less than exciting, but for this company I explored the deepest company values—sustainability, boutique design, indie craft, and personalized products—to highlight the most impressive aspects. This website also allows customer to order online or to message owners to place an order. 

Technologies used: semantic HTML, CSS, behavioral JavaScript
