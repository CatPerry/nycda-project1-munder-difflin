BOUTIQUE PAPERCRAFT COMPANY SITE

This one-page webiste was deisgned for a fictional paper company that excites the end user. The paper business may not seem very exciteing,but for this company I explored the deepest company values—sustainability, boutique, indie, personal—to highlight the most impressive aspects. Also allows customer to order online/message owners to place an order.
